# Skills

In this project, I was able to:

   - Create a Redux store in React applications

   - Create reducers in Redux in React applications

   - Create actions in Redux in React applications

   - Create dispatchers in Redux in React applications

   - Connect Redux to React components

   - Create asynchronous actions in your React application that uses Redux.

## What was developed

A question and answer game based on the game **Trivia** _(like an American million show lol)_ using _React and Redux_, developing its functionalities in groups according to the demands defined in a _Kanban_ board. We have an application where the user can:

- Log in to the game and, if the email is registered on the [Gravatar](https://pt.gravatar.com/) website, have your photo associated with the user's profile.
   - Access the game page, where you must choose one of the available answers for each of the questions presented. The answer must be marked before the time counter reaches zero, otherwise the answer must be considered wrong.
   - Be redirected, after 5 questions answered, to the score screen, where the text shown depends on the number of correct answers.
   - View the ranking page, if you want, at the end of each game.
   - Configure some options for the game in a configuration screen accessible from the app header.
